# Emotion Based Spotify Playlist Generator

## Description
This Python application combines natural language processing with Spotify's API to turn your emotions into music. It uses the TextBlob library to analyze the sentiment of user-provided text, categorizing the emotional state into joy, sadness, anger, or calm. Based on this analysis, it leverages Spotify's recommendation engine to curate a playlist that matches the detected mood, considering factors like valence, energy, and tempo.
